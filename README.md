Chosen Topic & Rationale
Exploring the Correlations between Voter Turnout and Population Factors
Using the US Census data, we hope to juxtapose and visualize the correlations between voter registration, turnout and population factors like employment status, age, income, and zip code. 
Dataset(s)
Various datasets from the US Census Bureau
Inspiring Visualizations
Sunburst
Using a sunburst chart, we would be to generate a multi-level look at the registration and voting rates of different demographics. For instance, from the inside out, the rings could be bins for: voter gender, voter employment status, voter registration rate, and voter vote rate.


Bubble Chart
Using a scatter chart, we could show comparisons between different population factors like gender, registration status, and voting record. 

Collapsible Tree
Using a collapsible tree, we could show multi-level relations between different population factors like gender, race, income, etc.
